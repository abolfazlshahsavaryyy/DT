Title: Report on the Process of the Decision Tree Project

I explored the Kaggle website to find a proper dataset. After searching, I found one titled "Flight Passenger Satisfaction."
I created a GitHub repository for this project and added the relevant files.
Using Colab, I read the dataset as a DataFrame (df) and cleaned it. After cleaning, I had a df with no non-integer values and classified the continuous columns.
after cleaning df I split the data to train,test,vlid and then seperate the train,test,vlis to X and y of each one
I decided to cancel this project from here bacause I don't know that my data set is unesed

I explore the Kaggle again and I find another dataset for predict the diabet by age ,bmi ,...
first I clean it it has been map to numberical class so it don't need to map the values
I classify the continuose columns 
I use the bmi classification chart to get the more correct prediction
