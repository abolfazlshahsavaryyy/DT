Title: Report on the Process of the Decision Tree Project

I explored the Kaggle website to find a proper dataset. After searching, I found one titled "Flight Passenger Satisfaction."
I created a GitHub repository for this project and added the relevant files.
Using Colab, I read the dataset as a DataFrame (df) and cleaned it. After cleaning, I had a df with no non-integer values and classified the continuous columns.
